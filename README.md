# Sauce's Pathfinder 1e Archetype Validator
Compatibility checker for Pathfinder Archetypes.

This program is a tool made mostly for my own personal use, intended to be used for checking compatibility between multiple archetypes in Pathfinder 1e at once. It has a full library of all first party classes and archetypes thereof. You are able to select a class, then pick any archetype associated with it, and add it to a Custom Class meant to be used by a single character. 

Note that the Vigilante lists an archetype which has a misprint, in that the text states the social talents at even levels and the vigilante talents at odd levels are replaced. This inconsistent, as the socials are gained at odd levels and vigilante talents are gained at even levels. In my files, I have simply switched the two, but I have reached out to Paizo hoping to gain official clarification. In the event I receive a response, I will update my files to match.
