Compatibility checker for Pathfinder Archetypes.

Note that the Vigilante lists an archetype which has a misprint, in that the text states the social talents at even levels and the vigilante talents at odd levels are replaced. This inconsistent, as the socials are gained at odd levels and vigilante talents are gained at even levels. In my files, I have simply switched the two, but I have reached out to Paizo hoping to gain official clarification. In the event I receive a response, I will update my files to match.
